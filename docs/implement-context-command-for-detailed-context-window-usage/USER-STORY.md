# Product Analysis

## Feature Title
Context Window Usage Breakdown Command

## User Story
As a Codex user, I want to see detailed token usage breakdown so that I can optimize my interactions and avoid context truncation issues.

## Business Purpose
Provide transparency into token consumption to improve user experience and reduce support requests about context window limits. This directly addresses user frustration with unexplained truncations and enables self-service optimization.

## Stakeholders
1. **End Users**: Need visibility into what's consuming their context window to optimize prompts and avoid hitting limits
2. **Development Team**: Need clear technical requirements for implementation in the Rust codebase

## Success Metrics
1. **Reduction in context-related issues**: 30% fewer user reports about truncation - Shows users can self-diagnose
2. **Command adoption rate**: 20% of active users use /context weekly - Validates feature usefulness
3. **Average context utilization**: Drops from 80% to 60% - Users optimize based on insights

## Risks and Dependencies
1. **Token counting accuracy**: Simple character-based estimation may be inaccurate - Consider adding tiktoken-rs in v2
   - Affected repositories: https://github.com/ossamalafhel/codex
2. **Performance impact**: Analyzing large conversations could slow down command response - Implement caching for static components

## Additional Context
- MVP focuses on basic breakdown without external dependencies
- Builds on existing /status command infrastructure
- Estimated effort: 2-3 days for core implementation
- Future enhancement: Real-time context monitoring could prevent hitting limits proactively
