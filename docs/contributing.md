## Contributing

This project is under active development and the code will likely change pretty significantly. We'll update this message once that's complete!

More broadly we welcome contributions - whether you are opening your very first pull request or you're a seasoned maintainer. At the same time we care about reliability and long-term maintainability, so the bar for merging code is intentionally **high**. The guidelines below spell out what "high-quality" means in practice and should make the whole process transparent and friendly.
