# Example Agent Configuration for Codex Multi-Agent System
# Place this file at ~/.codex/agents.toml to enable custom agents
#
# Usage:
# - @agent_name: task description (e.g., @code_reviewer: review main.rs)
# - /agents (lists all available agents)
# - Agent tasks are automatically tracked in the plan system
#
# Visual indicators during execution:
# - ⚡ Running (yellow) - agent is executing
# - ✓ Done (green) - agent completed successfully
