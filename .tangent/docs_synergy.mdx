# Documentation Directory & Reference Docs

The `docs/` and `codex-rs/docs/` directories in Codex provide reference, protocol, and legal documentation that complements the source code and .tangent developer documentation.

## Key Documentation Files

- **docs/CLA.md** — Contributor License Agreement: The required terms for contributing code, documentation, or designs to Codex. Contributors must agree to these terms when submitting pull requests.
- **codex-rs/docs/protocol_v1.md** — Agent/Protocol Reference: Defines the low-level protocol (used for UI<->agent communication, task/session/turn abstractions, event messaging, transport, etc.), aligned with codex-rs/core business logic. Essential for deep integration or building alternate UIs/automations outside the CLI.
- **codex-rs/core/prompt.md** — The Codex agent's developer instructions and protocol for patching, agent boundaries, review/approval gates, and best practices when executing code-related tasks. Should be referenced by operators designing custom agents or patching mechanics.

## Synergy With .tangent Documentation
- The files above should be referenced for protocol, legal, and integration purposes but are *not* a replacement for the comprehensive API/module/user docs now provided in `.tangent/`.
- When developing, start with `.tangent/overview.mdx` and module docs, then refer to the above files if:
  - You are writing integrations with the Codex agent (protocol details needed)
  - You are extending Codex's CLI or TUI at the protocol/task/approval/event level
  - Contributing code and need agreement/CLA terms
