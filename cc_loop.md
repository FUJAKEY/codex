# Claude Code vs OpenAI Codex CLI Agent Loop Architecture Comparison

## Executive Summary

Both Claude Code (by Anthropic) and OpenAI's Codex CLI implement agent loops for AI-powered coding assistants, but represent fundamentally different architectural philosophies. Claude Code emphasizes "radical simplicity" with a single-threaded master loop optimized for transparency, while OpenAI's Codex CLI employs a sophisticated multi-component, async architecture designed for production-scale robustness and extensibility.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: This analysis compares:
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's web-based coding assistant (from PromptLayer research)  
- **OpenAI Codex CLI**: The implementation found in this repository - OpenAI's local coding assistant

## Claude Code Agent Loop (Enhanced Research)

### Core Architecture - Deeper Analysis
- **Single-threaded master loop** (`nO`): Generator-based async pattern in TypeScript
- **Execution pattern**: `async *nOLoop()` with tool calls yielding control until plain-text response
- **Flat message history**: Linear conversation thread with no nested branches
- **Async message queue** (`h2A`): Dual `RingBuffer` design achieving >10k msg/s throughput
- **Controlled sub-agents**: At most one I2A (isolated sub-agent) spawned at a time

### Advanced Implementation Details
- **Tool Execution Fabric**: 
  - **MH1 engine**: Manages tool processes under seccomp sandboxes
  - **UH1 scheduler**: Priority-based tool invocation queuing (user/system/tool)
  - JSON-based RPC interface to sandboxed environments
  
- **Context Management (`wU2` compressor)**:
  - Triggers at 92% token threshold with 6.8× compression ratio
  - Hybrid approach: retain top 30% verbatim + LLM-driven summarization
  - `CLAUDE.md` persistence for long-term session memory
  - <3% semantic loss during compression

- **Real-time Steering (`h2A` queue)**:
  - Lock-free dual-buffer async iterator design
  - Priority lanes for system/user/tool messages
  - Microsecond-level message delivery with back-pressure handling
  - Enables mid-execution user interruptions

- **Tiered Multi-agent Runtime**:
  - nO process: full privileges, minimal isolation
  - Sub-agents: V8 isolates with restricted filesystem/network access
  - CRDT-like state replication patches over message bus

## OpenAI Codex CLI Agent Loop Architecture

### Core Architecture - Production Implementation
- **Multi-component async system**: Rust-based with tokio runtime for high-performance concurrency
- **Channel-based communication**: `async_channel::Sender<Submission>` and `Receiver<Event>` for message passing
- **Event-driven processing**: Stream-based architecture with real-time event emission
- **Concurrent execution**: Multiple spawned tasks handle tool execution, event processing, signal handling, and stream processing
- **Session-based management**: Persistent conversation state with rollout recording and resume capabilities

### Key Components - Deep Implementation Analysis

#### 1. Conversation Management (`ConversationManager`)
```rust
pub struct ConversationManager {
    conversations: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<ConversationId, Arc<CodexConversation>>>>,
    auth_manager: Arc<AuthManager>,
}
```
- **Multi-conversation support**: Concurrent session handling with unique ConversationIds
- **Thread-safe operations**: `Arc<RwLock<>>` for safe concurrent access
- **Session persistence**: Rollout recording with conversation resumption capabilities
- **Authentication integration**: Centralized auth management across sessions

#### 2. Task Orchestration (`run_task` and `run_turn`)
```rust
async fn run_task(sess: Arc<Session>, turn_context: &TurnContext, sub_id: String, input: Vec<InputItem>) {
    loop {
        match run_turn(&sess, turn_context, &mut turn_diff_tracker, sub_id.clone(), turn_input).await {
            Ok(turn_output) => /* process responses and tool calls */,
            Err(e) => /* handle retries with backoff */,
        }
    }
}
```
- **Turn-based processing**: Each turn handles model response → tool execution → next turn
- **Error handling**: Sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff
- **State tracking**: `TurnDiffTracker` monitors file changes across turns
- **Tool call processing**: Handles function calls, shell execution, and MCP tools

#### 3. Async Submission Processing (`submission_loop`)
```rust
async fn submission_loop(sess: Arc<Session>, turn_context: TurnContext, config: Arc<Config>, rx_sub: Receiver<Submission>) {
    while let Ok(sub) = rx_sub.recv().await {
        match sub.op {
            Op::UserInput { items } => /* spawn new task */,
            Op::Interrupt => /* interrupt current task */,
            Op::OverrideTurnContext { .. } => /* dynamic reconfiguration */,
            Op::Shutdown => /* graceful shutdown */,
        }
    }
}
```
- **Operation processing**: Handles user input, interruption, context overrides, and shutdown
- **Dynamic reconfiguration**: Runtime model/context/sandbox policy changes
- **Task management**: Spawns and manages concurrent tasks with abort handles

#### 4. Advanced Tool Execution Framework
- **Multi-sandbox support**: 
  - **Seatbelt** (macOS): `spawn_command_under_seatbelt` with profile-based restrictions
  - **Landlock+seccomp** (Linux): `spawn_command_under_linux_sandbox` with filesystem restrictions
- **Streaming execution**: Real-time stdout/stderr via `tokio::spawn` with channel forwarding
- **MCP Protocol integration**: Extensible tool ecosystem via Model Context Protocol
- **Safety framework**: Command safety assessment, approval workflows, escalated permissions
- **Resource management**: Timeout handling, memory limits, concurrent execution caps

#### 5. Event Stream Architecture
```rust
// Multiple concurrent event streams
tokio::spawn(async move {
    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            _ = tokio::signal::ctrl_c() => /* handle interruption */,
            res = conversation.next_event() => /* process model events */,
        }
    }
});
```
- **Concurrent event handling**: Multiple spawned tasks for different event types
- **Signal handling**: Graceful Ctrl-C interruption with proper cleanup
- **Stream processing**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time model responses
- **Error propagation**: Sophisticated error handling across async boundaries
