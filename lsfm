I want simulate 3D imaging with Light sheet fluorescence microscopy in MATLAB. the point is that sample will rotate and light sheet is stable. also our samples are fluorescence  circle beads with random size(500-1000nm) that are spread in a 10 micrometer sphere randomly. our light sheet thickness is 2.5micrometer and turn on all the sample in that 2.5meter. the illumination plane and rotation plane are perpendicular to each other. our beam is airy beam(486nm wave length) but it would not considered at first code. everything at first must be ideal. the light sheet illuminate sphere(light sheet path from center of rotation that is the center of sphere too). some fluorescent beads that are there will excited and captured by CCD. Then sphere will rotate with 14 degrees steps. every time it rotates, camera will capture image. 
for simulating this in MATLAB, we can consider a meshgrid. the sphere must be in that meshgrid with radius of 10 micrometer. then we write a "for" ring for explaining beads inside the sphere. for example 5 beads that locate randomly with different radius inside sphere. then we locate our light sheet in way that when beads path inside light sheet the intensity of them be 1 and other part of sphere and also other beads that are not in light sheet have the intensity 0. then integrate across the detection line(perpendicular to illumination as it is in LSFM). this is like what CCD do and capture image. after that the sample will rotate 14 degrees and do the same. it will do it and figure for each degree until it rotate 360 degree completely. 
write it how I said.
