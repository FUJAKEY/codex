Adversys Cyber Agent Implementation Plan

Objective

Create a specialized AI-powered terminal assistant called Adversys, launched via codex --security-mode, that enables AI-guided offensive security workflows. The agent will:

Run commands directly in a local terminal

Read and analyze terminal output

Use OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo for intelligent decision-making

Guide the user through pen-testing tasks with real-time feedback

Phase 1: System Architecture Design

1. Terminal Integration Layer (PTY or TMUX)

Use Python's pty or pexpect to spawn a pseudo-terminal session

Alternatively use tmux to create isolated, named sessions

Stream stdout/stderr to a central handler for Codex to parse

Allow command injection into the active session

2. Codex Chat Integration

Use OpenAI Chat API (GPT-4-turbo) with persistent memory per session

Create structured system prompts:

Define roles: "You are an Offensive Security Agent"

Provide session context: current target, tools installed, last output

Accept user input and feed Codex relevant command history + results

3. Shell Stream Handler

Asynchronous stream reader for real-time output (asyncio + pty)

Output buffer parser with:

Error detection (e.g., "command not found")

Tool-specific pattern matching (e.g., Nmap open port summaries)

Summarize long outputs before sending to Codex to reduce token usage

Phase 2: Feature Implementation

4. Security Mode Activation

codex --security-mode [--target domain.com] [--session name]

Initializes:

PTY session or TMUX window

Codex chat thread

Tool inventory cache

Workspace/session folders in ~/.adversys/

5. Tool Inventory Management

Track installed tools in tools.json

Provide CLI commands:

adversys tool list

adversys tool install <name>

adversys tool update <name>

Auto-detect tool presence with which or command -v

6. AI-Guided Command Generation

Codex interprets prompts like:

"Scan adversys.ai"

"Run SQL injection test on login form"

Codex returns:

Tool selection (e.g., Nmap, sqlmap)

Constructed command (e.g., nmap -sV adversys.ai)

Agent injects command into the PTY and streams output back to Codex

7. Error Handling & Auto-Fix

Detect command errors from stderr (e.g., missing tools, syntax issues)

Codex suggests fixes and injects them:

Install missing tool

Correct command syntax

Retry the operation

Phase 3: UX & Session Management

8. User Interaction & Approvals

Offer multiple execution modes:

suggest – user reviews all Codex commands

auto-edit – Codex edits, user approves

full-auto – Codex runs all commands without approval

Danger zone: --dangerously-auto-approve-everything

9. Session Isolation

Use --session flag to isolate logs, outputs, and tools

Save command history, timestamps, outputs to:

~/.adversys/sessions/<session-id>

10. Workspace Protection

Check for active Git repository and warn if not

Block execution in system-critical folders (/, /etc, /bin, etc.)

Phase 4: Reporting and Documentation

11. Vulnerability Reporting

Capture tool output summaries and map to CVSS/OWASP/MITRE

Codex assists in writing findings based on output

Export to Markdown, PDF, or JSON formats

12. Result Scoping and Compliance

Enforce target scope boundaries via user-defined YAML or JSON config

Auto-check scope adherence before launching tests

Phase 5: Future Enhancements

Multi-agent coordination (scan + report + exploit agents)

API and mobile pen-test modules

Offline LLM mode using local GPTQ model

Integration with Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nessus via plugin adapters
