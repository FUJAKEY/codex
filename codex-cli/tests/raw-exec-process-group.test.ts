// Regression test for proper process group termination.
// When cancelling an in-flight command, we need to ensure that ALL child processes
// in the process group are terminated, not just the immediate child.
//
// The key issue: If we only kill the immediate child, grandchildren processes
// may continue running in the background as "zombie" processes.
//
// This test verifies that our raw-exec implementation correctly terminates
// all processes in the group by using process.kill(-pid, signal) which sends
// the signal to the entire process group.
