# Enhance Adversys Cyber Agent with interactive NL command processing

I need to modify the Adversys Cyber Agent to improve its natural language command processing capabilities. When a user enters a request in natural language like "let's run nmap against the target adversys.ai", I want the system to:

1. Convert the natural language input into a proper security command
2. Show the interpreted command to the user for confirmation
3. Execute the command only after user confirmation
4. Analyze the command output using OpenAI
5. Suggest next steps with ready-to-execute follow-up commands

## Current issues

The current implementation has several problems:
- The OpenAI API call is failing with a temperature error
- There's no command confirmation step
- The system doesn't analyze command output
- There's no suggestion for follow-up commands

## Files to modify

The main file to modify is `codex-cli/src/security/terminal.ts` which contains the core logic for the Adversys CLI.

## Requested changes

1. Fix the OpenAI API calls to properly handle temperature parameter
2. Add a command confirmation prompt before execution
3. Add command output analysis using OpenAI
4. Implement follow-up command suggestions

## Example workflow

User input:
```
let's run nmap against the target adversys.ai
```

System response:
```
I'll translate this to: nmap -sV -p 1-1000 adversys.ai

This will perform a service version scan on the most common 1000 ports.
Do you want to execute this command? (y/n): 
```

After user confirms and command runs:
```
Analysis: The scan found 3 open ports (22, 80, 443) with SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS services.
Port 80 is running Apache 2.4.41.

Recommended next steps:
1. Run a more comprehensive scan: nmap -A -T4 adversys.ai
2. Check for web vulnerabilities: nikto -h adversys.ai
3. Explore the website directories: gobuster dir -u adversys.ai -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Enter the number to execute or type a new command:
```

Please help me implement these changes to make the security mode more interactive and helpful.
