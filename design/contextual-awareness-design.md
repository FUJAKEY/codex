# Contextual Awareness and Session Intelligence for Codex

## Overview
Design and implement contextual awareness capabilities for Codex that enhance the agent's understanding of session history, work patterns, and user needs without requiring constant re-establishment of context.

## Motivation
Current AI interactions largely operate in discrete, isolated exchanges. Each interaction knows little about previous exchanges beyond what fits in the immediate context window. This leads to:

1. Repetitive context establishment
2. Loss of coherence across longer sessions
3. Failure to adapt to evolving user needs
4. Inefficient use of context space

By implementing contextual awareness, Codex can become more responsive to the natural flow of work, maintaining coherence across complex task sequences while adapting to user expertise and current states.

## Key Concepts

### Session Coherence
The ability to maintain contextual understanding across multiple interactions, recognizing that development activities often span hours with multiple related subtasks.

### Adaptive Response Patterns
Adjusting interaction style, verbosity, and assistance level based on observed user patterns, expertise signals, and explicit preferences.

### Work State Awareness
Recognizing different modes of work (exploration, implementation, debugging, refactoring) and adapting behavior accordingly.

### Interaction Memory
Storing and retrieving relevant interaction history beyond the immediate context window.

## Design Components

### 1. Session Context Management

```typescript
// Session context structure
interface SessionContext {
  // Core session metadata
  sessionId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  lastActiveTime: Date;
  
  // User interaction patterns
  expertiseSignals: ExpertiseSignals;
  preferredResponseStyle: ResponseStyle;
  currentWorkMode: WorkMode;
  
  // Content awareness
  recentFiles: FileContext[];
  keyInsights: string[];
  establishedFacts: Map<string, any>;
  
  // Task tracking
  activeGoals: Goal[];
  completedTasks: Task[];
}

// Work modes represent different development activities
enum WorkMode {
  EXPLORING = 'exploring',       // Learning about codebase
  PLANNING = 'planning',         // Designing new features
  IMPLEMENTING = 'implementing', // Writing new code
  DEBUGGING = 'debugging',       // Fixing issues
  REFACTORING = 'refactoring',   // Improving code structure
  REVIEWING = 'reviewing'        // Examining code
}
```

### 2. Context Persistence Layer

A system for storing session context that:
- Persists across individual exchanges
- Efficiently summarizes and prunes information
- Prioritizes retrieval based on relevance
- Ensures privacy by storing data locally

```typescript
interface ContextStore {
  // Store new information
  update(context: Partial<SessionContext>): void;
  
  // Retrieve context based on relevance to current input
  retrieve(input: string, limit?: number): ContextItem[];
  
  // Explicitly save context for later use
  saveNamedContext(name: string, context: SessionContext): void;
  
  // Load previously saved context
  loadNamedContext(name: string): SessionContext;
}
```

### 3. Context-Aware Prompt Construction

A system that dynamically builds prompts by:
- Including relevant session history based on current input
- Adapting instruction style to detected expertise level
- Prioritizing context elements most relevant to current task
- Summarizing verbose context (like file contents) when appropriate

```typescript
function buildContextAwarePrompt(
  input: string, 
  sessionContext: SessionContext
): string {
  // Determine relevant context items
  const relevantHistory = findRelevantHistory(input, sessionContext);
  const relevantFiles = findRelevantFiles(input, sessionContext);
  
  // Adapt style based on user expertise and preferences
  const instructionStyle = adaptInstructionStyle(
    sessionContext.expertiseSignals,
    sessionContext.preferredResponseStyle
  );
  
  // Construct prompt with dynamic context
  return `${instructionStyle}
Current work mode: ${sessionContext.currentWorkMode}
Active goals: ${formatGoals(sessionContext.activeGoals)}

Relevant history:
${summarizeIfNeeded(relevantHistory)}

Relevant files:
${summarizeIfNeeded(relevantFiles)}

User input: ${input}`;
}
```

### 4. Work Mode Detection

A system that automatically detects the user's current work mode:

```typescript
function detectWorkMode(
  recentInputs: string[],
  recentCommands: string[],
  recentFiles: FileContext[]
): WorkMode {
  // Pattern matching against typical workflows
  if (containsPatterns(recentInputs, DEBUGGING_PATTERNS)) {
    return WorkMode.DEBUGGING;
  }
  
  if (containsPatterns(recentInputs, EXPLORATION_PATTERNS)) {
    return WorkMode.EXPLORING;
  }
  
  // More detection logic...
  
  return WorkMode.IMPLEMENTING; // Default
}
```

### 5. User Interface Components

```typescript
// UI components for contextual awareness
interface ContextAwareUI {
  // Display current session context
  showSessionContext(): React.Component;
  
  // Allow user to save/load named contexts
  manageNamedContexts(): React.Component;
  
  // Let user manually set work mode
  workModeSelector(): React.Component;
  
  // Visualize context usage
  contextUsageIndicator(): React.Component;
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Implement basic session context structure
2. Create persistence layer for context storage
3. Develop simple context injection for prompts
4. Add manual work mode selection

### Phase 2: Intelligence
1. Implement automatic work mode detection
2. Build expertise level detection
3. Create adaptive response formatting
4. Develop relevance-based context selection

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add named context saving/loading
2. Implement cross-session context retrieval
3. Build visual context management UI
4. Add explicit feedback mechanisms for context quality

## Technical Considerations

### Privacy and Security
- All context data stored locally by default
- Sensitive content automatically identified and excluded from persistence
- User controls for managing stored context

### Performance Impact
- Efficient context summarization to minimize token usage
- Incremental context updates to reduce processing overhead
- Background processing for non-critical context analysis

### User Control
- Transparent visibility into what context is being used
- Manual override for automatic detection
- Ability to clear or edit stored context

## Success Criteria

1. **Reduced repetition**: Users spend less time re-explaining context
2. **Increased coherence**: Interactions maintain continuity across session
3. **Adaptive assistance**: Agent responds appropriately to different work modes
4. **User satisfaction**: Positive feedback on contextual relevance
5. **Performance efficiency**: Minimal impact on response time and token usage

## Inspiration from Human Cognition

This design draws inspiration from human cognitive patterns while avoiding philosophical commitments:

1. **Working memory** - Short-term context for immediate tasks
2. **Episodic memory** - Recall of specific past interactions
3. **Procedural memory** - Understanding of task patterns and workflows
4. **Attentional shifting** - Focus on relevant information based on current needs
5. **Expertise development** - Adaptation based on familiarity and skill development
