# Testing AgentLoop.terminate() Method

## Code Under Test
- File: `codex-cli/src/utils/agent/agent-loop.ts`
- Method: `terminate()` (lines 248-257)
- Class: `AgentLoop`

## Key Details from User Request
- Need to test the `terminate` method specifically
- This is part of the Codex CLI agent system

## Method Implementation Summary
The `terminate()` method:
1. Checks if already terminated (early return if so)
2. Sets `terminated` flag to true
3. Aborts the `hardAbort` controller
4. Calls `cancel()` method

## Related Files/Context
- The AgentLoop class manages OpenAI API interactions for the Codex CLI
- Uses AbortController for cancellation/termination
- Has both `cancel()` and `terminate()` methods with different purposes
- `cancel()` is for aborting current operations, `terminate()` is for permanent shutdown

## Testing Considerations
- Need to verify state changes (terminated flag)
- Need to verify AbortController.abort() is called
- Need to verify cancel() is called
- Need to test idempotency (calling terminate multiple times)
- Need to verify that subsequent operations are blocked after termination
