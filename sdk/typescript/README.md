# Codex SDK

Embed the Codex agent in your application.

The TypeScript SDK wraps the bundled `codex` binary. It spawns the CLI and exchanges JSONL events over stdin/stdout, so anything you can do in the Codex CLI can also be done in the SDK.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @openai/codex-sdk
```

Requires Node.js 18+ (uses `node:` stdlib modules and async generators).

## Quickstart

```typescript
import { Codex } from "@openai/codex-sdk";

const codex = new Codex();
const thread = codex.startThread();
const turn = await thread.run("Diagnose the test failure and propose a fix");

console.log(turn.finalResponse);
console.log(turn.items);
```

Call `run()` repeatedly on the same `Thread` instance to continue that conversation.

```typescript
const nextTurn = await thread.run("Implement the fix");
```

### Streaming responses

`run()` buffers events until the turn finishes. To react to intermediate progress—tool calls, streaming responses, file diffs—use `runStreamed()` instead, which returns an async generator of structured events.

```typescript
const { events } = await thread.runStreamed("Diagnose the test failure and propose a fix");

for await (const event of events) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case "item.completed":
      console.log("item", event.item);
      break;
    case "turn.completed":
      console.log("usage", event.usage);
      break;
  }
}
```

### Resuming an existing thread

Threads are persisted in `~/.codex/sessions`. If you lose the in-memory `Thread` object, reconstruct it with `resumeThread()` and keep going.

```typescript
const savedThreadId = process.env.CODEX_THREAD_ID!;
const thread = codex.resumeThread(savedThreadId);
await thread.run("Implement the fix");
```

### Working directory controls

Codex runs in the current working directory by default. Override it or opt out of the Git guard using `ThreadOptions`.

```typescript
const thread = codex.startThread({
  workingDirectory: "/path/to/project",
  skipGitRepoCheck: true,
});
```
